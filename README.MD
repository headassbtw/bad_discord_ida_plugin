# Shitty ida python plugin for discord

## If anyone wants to give me a copy of the IDA C++ SDK to write a better version of this let me know

Awful plugin I wrote in about an hour bashing my head against python because it fucking SUCKS I HATE IT

You're free to keep using my discord API ID, the pictures provided are: `appico`,`arm`,`x86` (intel logo), `itanium` (mspaint intel logo),`mips` and `ppc`

The API ID, as well as functions to handle architecture names/icons are at the top, if you want to change/add any
